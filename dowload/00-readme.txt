*** Download Aurora Plugins ***

In this directory you can download the complete suite of Aurora plugins
The ZIP (or RAR) file contains the regular suite of plugins: unzip (or unrar)
them, placing them inside the installation directory of Adobe Audition
(typically C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Audition 3.0).

*** ATTENTION ***
These are XFM plugins, not VST plugins. Hence, the XFM plugins are not to be 
placed inside the Plug-ins subdirectory, they must stay alongside the
already-existing Audition's own XFM modules, in the main installation directory.

*** Suggestion ***
It is always recommended to set Windows displaying the extension of known files.
By default, Windows hides the extension of file names, when the type of file
is known. This is bad practice, and opens the door to backdoors and trojans.
We warmly recommend that you disable the option labelled
"Hide extnsions for known file types", by unchecking it in Windows Explorer,
under the menu Tools, Folder Options, View.
This will make it easy to see the extension of Aurora's XFM modules, and to place
them in their proper location, where the already-existing XFM modules are.

*** UPGRADED MODULES ***
Outside the main distribution, which is the ZIP or RAR file, you can see 2 or 3
modules not zipped. The release date of these modules is more recent than the modules
having the same name contained in the ZIP file. It is always recommended to download
these updated modules, overwriting the ones contained in the ZIP when copying the new 
ones to the Audition's installation directory.
These upgraded modules usually offer bug fixes and/or improved functionality.
After some months of Beta-testing, these modules will be repacked in the main ZIP
file. So please provide feedback if you notice any trouble when using them.

*** Russian Roulette ***
The suite of Aurora plugins is shareware. However, while most shareware programs
expire after a short period, Aurora modules can be used as long as required without
registering them. This was chosen for aiding broken students, or people living in 
difficult conditions - for those people even the small amount of money required for 
registering Aurora can be a big trouble.
However, when Aurora is unregistered, you are affected by that nasty "Russian Roulette":
with a chance of 1:4, the module will crash, causing the host program to die. Albeit 
this is annoying, this behaviour does not cause any loss of data, as Audition will 
restore all the previously-open files (even those not saved) at the next launch.
Of course, when Aurora is registered, the Russian Roulette will not bother you again.
