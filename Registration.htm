    <div class="feature">
      <p>Aurora is classified as a &quot;shareware&quot; product - the plugins can be freely <a href="http://www.ramsete.com/Aurora/download/">downloaded</a>, the integral   package can be freely redistributed (only in the format of the original ZIP   archives, containing all the files), and the software can be used without any   restriction for an unlimited time by everyone.</p>
      <p>Why to register, then? There are three good reasons for registering   Aurora:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>While the plugins are unregistered, they exhibit an annoying behaviour: each   time a plugin is invoked, there is a probability of 1:4 that it causes the host   program to crash. This is based on a random number generator (it is called a   &quot;<strong>russian roulette</strong>&quot;) - be ensured, however, that forcing the host program   to crash is a fair approach, as it does not cause any data loss - Simply   relaunching Adobe Audition triggers its safe data-retrieval procedure, and the   user will be back with all his opened waveforms. Of course, after registering   the plugins, this annoying behaviour disappears. </li>
        <li>In some countries it is not allowed to employ unregistered shareware   software for performing professional tasks having legal value, such as room   acoustics or architectural acoustics measurements, or for creating official test   reports. Similarly, using an unregistered copy of Aurora for making scientific   publications is considered academically unfair. </li>
        <li>By registering the Aurora plugins You give a feedback to the Author,   stimulating their maintenance and further development - You must understand that   the money required for the registration is very little, and this does not   provide a substantial annual income. Aurora is not a commercial product, and the   registration fee is not for the subsistence of the author. Aurora is, under any   respect, a scientific publication made by a member of the academic staff, within   his duties, and the registration fee is there just for giving the proper   &quot;published&quot; status to it (unfortunately, under Italian law, open-source and   freeware software is NOT considered a published scientific work). </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can <a href="http://order.kagi.com/?1BG&amp;KagiAffiliate=MSDL">register   Aurora </a>on-line on the secure KAGI server. Please notice that a registered   user of Aurora is allowed to install as many copies of Aurora as he needs, on   any number of computers. However, a registered user should not release to others   his own registration codes. So, if Aurora is to be used as a &quot;site&quot; software,   only one registration fee has to be paid - some Universities employ more than   one hundreth copies of Aurora, and they did pay just one registration fee! The   same is done inside some large companies, such as Motorola, Arup, Fiat, Audi,   Porsche, Bang&amp;Olufsen, Waves, etc.</p>
